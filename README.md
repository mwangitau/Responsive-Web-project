# Responsive-Web-Design
This is my learning progress.
In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I will be learning the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

I will begin by building a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, I will learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, I will learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
